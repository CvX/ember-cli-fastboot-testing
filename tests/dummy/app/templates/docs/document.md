# Document testing

> This document is a work in progress.

There are some HTML elements generated by fastboot that do not make sense when rendered inside of Ember's testing container. For example, rendering a fastboot generated `<head>` tag inside of the testing container would result in invalid HTML.

However, a common use case of fastboot is to generate `head`, `title`, and `meta` tags for crawlers and bots, so it would make sense to want to use `qunit-dom` for testing these tags.

To write these sort of tests, use the `htmlDocument` returned from `visit` to get an un-rendered `Document` object that you can assert against with `qunit-dom`.

```js
import { module, test, skip } from 'qunit';
import { setup, visit } from 'ember-cli-fastboot-testing/test-support';

module('Fastboot | basic', function(hooks) {
  setup(hooks);

  test('it renders the correct og:title', async function(assert) {
    let { htmlDocument } = await visit('/');

    assert
      .dom('head meta[property="og:title"]', htmlDocument)
      .hasAttribute('content', 'Fastboot testing');
  });
});
```
